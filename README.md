# Bangalore House Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts house prices in Bangalore based on location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other features.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the Bangalore real estate market using a dataset of house listings. The model helps estimate property prices using multiple regression algorithms including Linear Regression, Lasso, and Decision Tree.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing with outlier removal
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering (price per sqft, BHK extraction)
- One-hot encoding for location features
- Multiple ML model comparison
- Model evaluation using cross-validation

## Dataset

The dataset contains 13,000+ house listings with features:
- Location (242 unique locations)
- Total square feet area
- Number of bathrooms
- Number of bedrooms (BHK)
- Price (in lakhs)
